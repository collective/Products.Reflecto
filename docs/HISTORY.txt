Changelog
=========

3.0 - Unreleased
------------------

- Log skipped files when iterating over directory contents.

- Do manual splitting of filenames when indexing content. This allows searching
  for filenames. This previously did not work because the standard indexer strips
  dots, which does not work well for filenames.


2.5.1 - May 8, 2012
-------------------

- Package fix [aclark]

2.5 - May 8, 2012
-----------------

- Fixed broken imports for Plone 4.1 compatibility
  [swampmonkey]

- Make compatible with Plone 4/Zope 2.12 by removing z2-style interfaces
  and adjusting some imports
  [tom_gross]


2.4 - July 17, 2009
-------------------

- Disable recursive handling of AT references in reflectors: proxies
  filesystem data is never referenceable, so this only slowed things
  down.
  [wichert]

- Disable ownership fixing after adding reflector proxies. This prevents
  slow tree walks after copy/pasting reflectors.
  [wichert]

- Silence manage_after* deprecation warning.
  [wichert]


2.3 - June 19, 2009
-------------------

- Do no index filesystem data when running in life mode. This guarantees
  no stale data will be in the catalog.
  [wichert]

- Do not add trailing slash to file URLs in the folder contents view. This
  makes sure the base URL is correct, and relative paths in html files
  work correctly.
  [wichert]

- Move the file-specific mime type logic to the ReflectoFile class,
  and make the default implementation always return application/octet-stream.
  This fixes problems with indexing of directories.
  [wichert]


2.2 - April 16, 2009
--------------------

- Use the mimetypes_registry tool to find the content-type of a file,
  only falling back to the system mimetype registry if the tool can
  not identify the file.
  [wichert]
 
- Set the Content-Type header correctly for file downloads.
  [wichert]


2.1 - August 5, 2008
--------------------

- Return an empty list instead of raising an exception which triggers a
  site error when accessing a reflector which tries to use a path which does
  not exist on the filesystem. The old behaviour was non-intuitive for users
  and made migrating sites extremely hard.
  [wichert]

- Update TextIndexNG3 support code to include the Title (ie the filename) of an
  object in SearchableText.
  [wichert]

- Make Reflecto an ATCT content types to make it integrate better with
  Plone. This was triggered by Reflecto instances inheriting the excludeFromNav
  data from their parent which made them not appear in the site navigation 
  for mysterious reasons.
  [wichert]

- Fix Last-Modified header format.
  [elro]

- Add webdav support.
  [elro]

- Lowercase filenames before looking up the mime-type. This fixes incorrect
  mime-types for uppercase filenames.
  [wichert]

- Remove the properties alias from the Reflector type. This is obsolete
  in Plone 3.x.
  [wichert]

- Add CSRF authenticator to the folder_contents page. This means Reflecto now
  requires Plone 3.1, or Plone 3.0 with the CSRF hotfix. This fixes
  http://plone.org/products/reflecto/issues/30 .
  [wichert]


2.0 (Released 2008/05/14)
-------------------------

- Use the correct title for the folder_contents buttons.
  [wichert]

- Add support for downloading folders as zip files.
  [wichert]

- If CacheSetup is installed allow users to tweak cache rules for individual
  Reflector instances.
  [wichert]

- Prevent CR/LF conversion when uploading files on Windows. This fixes
  bug 22 (see http://plone.org/products/reflecto/issues/22 ).
  [wichert]

- Port to Plone 3.
  [wichert]

- Add a 'live' option which makes Reflecto show live filesystem data instead
  of catalogued data.
  [wichert]

- Correct the Plone version test. This fixes bug 11 (see
  http://plone.org/products/reflecto/issues/11 ).
  [wichert]


1.2 (Released 2007/09/05)
-------------------------

- Changed the permission mask from 600 to 644
  [FinnArild]

- Issue #1: Include the Title in SearchableText.
  [mj]

- Issue #2: Add a SearchableText implementation for Directories, returing the
  Title.
  [mj]

- Updated Install method to use the CMF 2.1 GenericSetup interface if Plone 3
  is being used.
  [wichert]

- Updated imports which current Zope 3 deprecated
  [wichert]

- Updated tests to support Archetypes 1.5 as used by Plone 3.0
  [wichert]

- Updated @@index view mockup registration in directory tests for Plone 3.0
  [mj]
  
- Fixed contents tab for Plone 3.0

  [mj]
