Introduction
============
Reflecto is a tool to incorporate part of the file system into a Plone site.
It allows you to browse through a filesystem hierarchy and access the files
in it. Files are represented as simple downloadable object, not as full CMF
or Plone content types.

Requirements
============

* Plone 3.1 or later

* TextIndexNG3 is optional, but needed to index non-text files.


Filename policies
=================

Filenames must be valid Zope ids. In addition, filenames starting with
a dot, or with '@@' are also deemed invalid. Files with names not matching
these criteria will be ignored.

This means that filenames must basically be ASCII characters only, and not
start with ``aq_``, ``@@``, ``.`` or ``_``, not end with ``__`` nor
contain a ``+``.
